<p>
  There are many virtual PBX offerings on the market, but they are
  typically restricted to a certain set of standard functionality, such
  as call forwarding, ring groups, voice mail, and so on. In some
  occasions, this standard set is insufficient, and the customer needs a
  "smarter" solution.
</p>
<p>
  VOXSERV is a system integration service for planning, setting up, and
  support for custom, tailored telephony solutions for various business
  needs.
</p>
<p>
  Most of our solutions are using
  <a href="http://www.freeswitch.org/">FreeSWITCH</a>
  software. FreeSWITCH is a free, open-source IP telephony platform,
  offering a great deal of integration and customization possibilities.
</p>
<p>
  Our virtual PBX are usually hosted in a XEN VPS at a selected hosting
  partner, but can also be hosted at the customer facilities.

<p>
  The following sections describe various business needs and scenarios
  that have been implemented for our customers.

[% WRAPPER subsection id='presencertr' title='Presence-based routing' %]
<p>
  The user wants to be able to tell the PBX about their presence status,
  and route the inbound calls to different destinations: when
  "Available", the calls go to a SIP account or a mobile phone. When
  "Unavailable", the caller receives a short sound message, and the call
  is hung up. The user also wants to receive an SMS message with the
  caller details.  
</p>
<p>
  The solution sets up an entry for the user presence in FreeSWITCH
  internal database. Also there's an internal extension in the dialplan
  which connects the user to an IVR where they can change the presence
  status. This IVR is protected with a PIN for calls from PSTN, or
  answers directly for internal SIP calls.
</p>
<p>
  The dialplan recognizes several situations when processing the
  incoming calls:
  <ol>
    <li>
      If the presence status is set to "Unavailable", play a message and hangup.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the user is "Available" and the user's SIP client is
      registered, it tries to connect to the SIP client only.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the user is "Available" and the user's SIP client is
      not registered, it tries to connect to the mobile number.
    </li>
    <li>
      Whenever the call is unsuccessful, the user receives an SMS
      message with the sender's number set to the original caller's
      number. The message text includes the time and the reason for
      absence, for example: "I tried to call you at 15:49, but you were
      busy on your mobile".
    </li>
  </ol>  
</p>
<p>
  Also the dialplan watches the current number of incoming and outgoing
  calls for the user, and rejects the new incoming calls if the user is
  busy.
</p>
[% END %]



[% WRAPPER subsection id='multiface' title='Multi-faced user' %]
<p>
  The user has several PSTN numbers for different business purposes, and
  they want to know which of these numbers was called. The user has set
  up several SIP profiles on their SIP client, and the client software
  displays the profile name for incoming calls.
</p>
<p>
  The FreeSWITCH dialplan is set up in such a way that all these
  PSTN numbers share the same counter of active calls, and only one
  active call is allowed. 
</p>
<p>
  The user can make outgoing calls from any of those SIP profiles, and
  the correct Caller ID is set by the PBX.
</p>
[% END %]



[% WRAPPER subsection id='hotline' title='Hotline routing' %]
<p>
  A hotline service is set up for technical support, and the requirement
  is not to lose the call even if the current on-call engineer is not
  answering.
</p>
<p>
  The PBX stores the information about the current on-call engineer in a
  persistent database. There is also an IVR which allows the engineer to
  switch the current on-call duty to themselves or to a colleague. The
  IVR is protected with PIN for calls from PSTN, and does not require a
  PIN for internal SIP calls.
</p>
<p>
  Upon receiving a call on the hotline number, the PBX asks for the
  customer PIN. Several such customers can have different PINs, and the
  system would differentiate them when opening a new trouble ticket.
</p>
<p>
  After PIN authentication, the call is routed to all known endpoints
  for the current on-call engineer (SIP clients and PSTN numbers). On
  mobile numbers, the engineer hears a prompt "Press 1 to answer the
  call", and the call is connected only after the digit 1 is
  pressed. This protects the hotline calls from being routed to an
  engineer's voice mailbox.
</p>
<p>
  If the engineer is not answering, the caller is prompted to record a
  voice message. This message is then automatically forwarded to the
  ticketing system. The ticketing system will send SMS messages to all
  support engineers every 15 minutes until the ticket is taken into
  ownership.
</p>
<p>
  In this scenario, there is only one on-call person at any given
  time. It is also possible to set up some more complex routing, with
  simultaneous calls to mobile and SIP numbers of several people. Also
  different groups of support engineers can be selected, based on which
  customer has called.

[% WRAPPER subsection id='confbridge' title='Conference bridge' %]
<p>
  The user needs a conference bridge which is reachable from different
  countries at local call cost, and with a possibility to connect from
  any Skype account.
</p>
<p>
  FreeSWITCH supports many various options for audio conferencing, and
  the following scenario is one of the possible ways to oset up a
  conference bridge.
</p>
<p>
  When a user calls to the conference bridge, they are prompted to enter
  a conference room ID. The PBX supports multiple conference rooms (for
  example, one per employee), and guest access is defined by a random
  4-digit number. The guests have to wait until the moderator logs in
  and opens the bridge. The moderator uses the same access phone number,
  but enters a different room ID. Then the moderator is also asked for a
  PIN.
</p>
<p>
  The conference bridge can have multiple PSTN numbers for incoming
  calls from different countries. Any worldwide SIP provider which
  supports multiple suimultaneous channels is suitable for this.
</p>
<p>
  Also the bridge may have an <a href="http://www.inum.net/">INUM</a>
  number, and those numbers are routed from many regional telephony
  providers. Also there are numerous local access gateways in every part
  of the world.
</p>
<p>
  American toll-free numbers (1-800) can be called from any Skype
  account, including those with zero credit. The conference bridge owner
  needs to take over the costs for incoming calls.
</p>
<p>
  The conference calls can also be automatically recorded, and the users
  will hear a warning message in this case before starting the
  conference. The moderator may convert the recordings to MP3 format and
  share with the participants. Old recordings can be automatically
  deleted after a certain period of time.
